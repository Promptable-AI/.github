# Promptable AI

## Making Intelligent Systems Promptable

Promptable AI is focused on building promptable intelligent systems for precision medicine and research. We create AI systems that understand traditional bioinformatics workflows and know when to apply them, while also being able to agentically run and scale workloads.

## Our Vision

We believe bioinformatics should be accessible to all researchers, regardless of their computational expertise. By making complex workflows promptable through natural language, we're democratizing access to advanced genomic analysis tools and accelerating discoveries in precision medicine.

## Our Projects

### [BioPrompts](https://github.com/Promptable-AI/bioprompts)
Intelligent notebooks that demonstrate how to make complex bioinformatics workflows accessible through natural language prompts.

### [BioCrew](https://github.com/Promptable-AI/biocrew)
A coordinated team of specialized AI agents that autonomously execute and optimize bioinformatics workflows across Seven Bridges, Terra, and DNAnexus platforms.

## Monthly Modality Series

We're exploring different bioinformatics modalities through our BioPrompts series, breaking down each analysis type into:

1. Understanding the state of the art
2. Breaking down workflows into agentic functions
3. Generating synthetic data for testing
4. Building and testing agentic workflow solutions
