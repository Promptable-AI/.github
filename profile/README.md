# Promptable

Building the future where scientific discovery happens through conversationâ€”where researchers express their analytical intent in natural language and intelligent systems orchestrate optimal computational execution, learn from every interaction, and evolve through community collaboration. 

Promptable transforms scientific computing from a technical barrier into an intuitive, adaptive, and collaborative medium for advancing human knowledge.

## Our Vision

**Prompts as Programming Primitives**: Natural language becomes the primary interface for scientific data analysis, where prompts are first-class programming constructs that can be composed, parameterized, and optimized.

**Intelligent Workflow Orchestration**: Moving beyond static workflow management to dynamic, conversational systems where AI agents collaborate to adapt workflows in real-time based on data characteristics and performance insights.

## Community

ðŸ”¬ **[Workflow Library](https://workflowlibrary.org)** - Our open community platform for sharing and optimizing scientific protocols

ðŸ“š **[Protocol Repository](https://github.com/workflowlibrary)** - Git-based collaborative development of computational protocols

## Technology

**POE (Prompt Orchestration Engine)**: Converting scientific intent into optimized, executable workflows through intelligent agent coordination and performance learning.
